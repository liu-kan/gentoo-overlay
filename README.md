# liuk-overlay

liuk overlay is a gentoo overlay repository that I use myself. It may not have the broadest application scenario in mind. The ebuild file for the repository is based on using the systemd system for writing.

Usage:
```bash
layman -o https://gitee.com/liukxyz/gentoo-overlay/raw/main/repositories.xml -f -a liuk
```
